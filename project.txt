First 3 step

Diagonalize 

Routine for second derivative numerical

3 point can be very general

Maybe start with plain wave, without potential 

For matching derivative is needed, with routine

Equation 14 has a typo with the derivatives

You get the eigenvalue when you diagonalise, you get eigenvalues and eigenvectors
